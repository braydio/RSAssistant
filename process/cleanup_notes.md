# RSAssistant Code Cleanup Notes

This notepad tracks the ongoing progress of the cleanup process we are undertaking on the "RSAssistant" project.

\n- 2025-05-06: Created a branch for cleanup: `spring-cleaning-squad` to handle refactoring and code polish.
  - Initial target was review of RSAssistant.py and utils/config_utils.py
- Attempted to fetch utils/config_utils.py but initial path was given wrong as `utils/config.py`.
- Introduced a custom mapping using the TOM action schema in `castomonds/DirMap.json`.
    - File named: `iam_sorry.json`.
    - Includes a note in the [/endpoint] indicating the URL used to connect, signed by "RSAssistant Companion".
- Switched to clarify that all future cleanup-related commits and PRs will be signed.
