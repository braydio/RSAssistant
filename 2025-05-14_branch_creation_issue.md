# Failed Branch Creation: 2025-05-14

We attempted to create a new branch called `^feature/reverse-split-alert` using the SHA address from the `main` branch.

However, each attempt returned the same error:
```text
Reference update failed
HTTP 412
Error Code: 422
Message: "Reference update failed"
```

This likely means:
- The SHA was not from `the default branch` as expected.
- The repo or settings may have branch protection rules in place.
- User permissions may be restricting git ref creation.

Tried SHAs:
- `dfc8fb158f84c2df7acbcb0a4a716fdd0f29c191`` (from `RSAssistant.py`)

Fixes suggested:

1. Create the branch manually in the Repo web interface first.
2. Retry commit the code to that new branch with the feature/split alrert parsing extension.
