RSAssistant

RSAssistant is a high-performance, fully autonomous trading assistant built on top of Discord and Python.
It automatically monitors NASDAQ reverse split notices, parses press releases and SEC filings, intelligently detects fractional share policies (especially round-up scenarios), and triggers smart autobuy orders.

Note: RSAssistant is designed to run in tandem with the autoRSA GitHub repository. It is required for full order execution functionality.
